# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

  Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
      This project worked around a company called DriverPass. We were tasked in creating an application that would boost DriverPass' driver's educational school that would provide it's users/students with training videos, practice tests, and scheduled driving tests to prepare them for their final test at the DMV. The application we were asked to create would serve as a central hub for all of DriverPass' users to access their account and services.
      
      
   What did you do particularly well?
      As we progressed through the course and this project we were handed different assignments that would portray us in different roles for system analysis and design. All in all I feel like I grasped this material pretty well and there is always room for improvement as we learn more going forward. However I feel like my work has met the requirements of our client, DriverPass, to fulfil their web based application.
      
   
   If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
      I would have liked to have more time and practice on the UML Diagrams. I felt as if it was thrown at us rather quickly and then next thing you know you have UML use case diagrams, activity diagrams, etc. There are many different ways to create UML diagrams and it would be nice to get more practice with that to better learn how each graph is set up.
      
      
   How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
      It is always important to consider the users needs when designing a system. If designing a system and you neglect to take into account the users needs then the system is expected to fail in some time. The system should be designed to benefit the users and if the users can't access the system features or use it's ability then it's just plainly a bad system. You should always consider the users needs and the clients requirements, within a reasonable scope. 
      
      
   
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
      A good way I've learned through readings and videos is desiging a software as if how I'd interact with it on a daily basis. Growing up in the age of technology I have come across many good interfaces and several bad ones as well. It's clear to see who puts in the time to think about their work and dedication toward it's users.
